This repo is based on the default and example hooks the git project provides.
Also I added a few of my own hooks. Have a look at the Overview at the bottom.

server side hooks:
    post-/pre-receive
    update

client side hooks:
    all the others

non-executable files:
    scripts used by hooks

To activate the hooks, use something like this in your repos config file:

[hook]
    warnInvalidXml = false
    blockInvalidXml = false
    warnInvalidPHPSyntax = false
    blockInvalidPHPSyntax = false
    publishHomeRepo = false
    deployOnTag = false
    deployOnPush = false
    sendEmail = false
